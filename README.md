# Coffee Shop Full Stack

## Full Stack Nanodegree - IAM Final Project

 This is a new digitally enabled cafe to order drinks.

The application:

1. Displays graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2. Allows public users to view drink names and graphics.
3. Allows the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4. Allows the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.

Cheers!
